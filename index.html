    <center><img src="icons/education.png" width="50px" height="50px" /><p><b>Educational Equity</b></p></center>
      <p>I was raised by a mother who devoted her life to helping women excel in STEM fields. Inspired by her advocacy, I have sought to build a life that empowers others to achieve their potential through education.</p>
      <p>During my time in San Francisco, I mentored a low-income high school student through <a href="http://www.mindsmattersf.org/" target="_blank">Minds Matter</a>. Most importantly, I helped her discover and develop her passion for computer science, which led her to enroll in an engineering program for college. Since her graduation, I have led the summer program operations at Minds Matter to help our mentees tap into their passions and talents through college-level academic programs.</p>
    <center><img src="icons/analytics.png" width="50px" height="50px"><p><b>Analytics for Good</b></p></center>
      <p>At <a href="https://www.educationsuperhighway.org/" target="_blank">EducationSuperHighway</a>, I developed data dashboards that empowered every colleague to conduct targeted outreach to schools that need better Internet access. While consulting for nonprofits such as <a href="https://firstgraduate.org/" target="_blank">First Graduate</a> and <a href="http://getmindright.org/" target="_blank">MindRight</a>, I built tools that enabled them to measure their impact and scale their most effective programs.</p>
      <p>These experiences affirmed that data translated into actionable insights expands organizational capacities to reach students in need. In the future, I aspire to build a social venture that breaks down barriers to education through democratization of data.</p>
    <center><img src="icons/heart.png" width="50px" height="50px"><p><b>Health and Wellness</b></p></center>
      <p>I deeply value my physical and mental health. During my first year at <a href="https://deerfield.edu/" target="_blank">Deerfield Academy</a>, I joined the cross country team on a whim and have never stopped running. These days, I love to explore the trails in Golden Gate Park and Presidio, two of the best urban parks in the world that are both steps away from my home.</p>
      <p>In addition, I developed the practice of yoga and meditation, which have grounded me in times of both happiness and challenges. I am a RYT-200 certified yoga teacher. I also maintain a strict vegetarian diet out of health and environmental concerns.</p>

	<h1>Connectivity Dashboard</h1>
	  <p><img src="icons/goal.png" style="width:25px;height:25px;" /><b>Goal: </b>Automate standard reporting and make data insights accessible to all teams.</p>
	  <p><img src="icons/process.png" style="width:25px;height:25px;" /><b>Context: </b>During my first months at EducationSuperHighway, I spent many hours creating standard reports which involved redundant analyses on connectivity gaps in public schools. Each connectivity report took weeks to complete due to shifting methods and design tweaks. I teamed up with my colleague Sujin to build an alternative solution.</p>	
	  <p><img src="icons/tools.png" style="width:25px;height:25px;"><b>Tools: </b>SQL, R(Shiny, ggplot2, Leaflet)</p>	
	  <p><img src="icons/impact.png" style="width:25px;height:25px;"><b>Impact: </b>The Connectivity Dashboard was adopted by internal teams across the company. It now takes less than a week to create standard reports on connectivity. Perhaps more importantly, it enabled teams across the organization to gather and share data insights, helping us work more collaboratively. This tool was also recently featured in the <a target="_blank" href = "https://www.rstudio.com/resources/customer-spotlight/education-super-highway/">RStudio blog</a>.</p>
	  <p><img src="icons/star.png" style="width:25px;height:25px;"><b>My Contribution: </b>
	    <ul>
	      <li>Pitched the initiative to leadership.</li>
	      <li>Wrote R scripts that feed into the dashboard UI.</li>
	      <li>Gathered early user feedback to make the dashboard as user-friendly as possible.</li>
	      <li>Executed the project from start to finish (v1.0).</li>

    <center><i>Anyone who stops learning is old, whether at twenty or eighty.  - Henry Ford</i></center><BR><BR>
    <p>I am an education + data enthusiast who is always learning and occasionally traveling. Originally from South Korea I now call various places my home. I studied International Relations at Georgetown University. After a <a target = "_blank" href = "http://www.yalelawjournal.org/pdf/1120_ogjao8vy.pdf">stint at academic research</a> with a brilliant professor at Stanford, I worked at Cornerstone Research where I developed a complicated relationship with <a href = "http://www.econjobrumors.com/topic/i-hate-sas" target ="_blank">sas.</a></p>
    <p>I am currently at <a href="http://www.educationsuperhighway.org/" target="_blank">EducationSuperHighway</a> where I analyze and visualize Internet connectivity gaps in public schools to enable digital learning for students without sufficient broadband access. I live steps away from Golden Gate Park in San Francisco.</p>
